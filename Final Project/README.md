## Synopsis

This project is a small simulation of the popular table card game known as "BlackJack". It pits the user against three other 
hands to see who has the hand closest to twenty-one or who has gone over the limit. The program, depending on the match outcome 
would tell the user if they won, lost, or if there was a tie for first.

## Motivation

I wanted to create this because this types of games can always be fun to play, but not everyone can, or wants to risk losing
their money just to play, like myself, that and I haven't seen any other card based games that try to get creative either so
